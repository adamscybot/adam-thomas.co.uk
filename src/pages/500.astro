<Layout>
  <BodyHeader>ðŸ’¥ 500: It's on fire</BodyHeader>
  <BodyParagraph>
    I'm not going to say "something went wrong" or "oopsy woopsy!" as that would
    be downplaying it. It's on fire I'm afraid and it's quite possible I don't
    even know it's on fire. It would be lovely if you pinged me an email to <a
      href="mailto:web@adam-thomas.co.uk">about this</a
    >.
  </BodyParagraph>
</Layout>
