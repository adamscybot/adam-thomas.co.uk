        My role expanded to include Engineering Management responsbilities. I am
        responsible for the engineers in my team, including creating an
        environment for them in which they can thrive. I have continued to grow
        the companies UI function, which positively impacted our product. I work
        closely with UX and Product to deliver product features and facilitate
        alignment of my team.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        I designed and oversaw a move from a horizontal UI team to a vertical
        structure with UI devs integrated with other teams; as well as the
        formation of a new UI Initiatives team.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        For part of this period I also managed the Platform team, which tackled
        the core architecture of the product. Many features were delivered
        between my time between UI and Platform.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>

        I built up the companies UI team from scratch, leading work on
        modernising the front-end stack for new and existing products.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        The team worked on the removal of a legacy UI framework that was
        replaced by React and TypeScript; with the view to an ambitious UI road
        map. The project involved a significant conversion of an existing
        enterprise Java UI application based on Vaadin. My responsibilities also
        included line management.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        I continued to on-board Java/back end developers onto the UI stack in
        this position, in tandem with my belief that a good front end team must
        understand all aspects of the product.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        The project involved the creation of a new React based framework to make
        building screens using the new APIs as simple as possible to improve dev
        efficiency. I was responsible for the technical leadership in
        architecting this framework, documenting it and mentoring my colleagues.

        contains strong individual and group elements. From a technical
        perspective the course focuses primarily on Java, but in the latter
        years gives a wider variation and focus on web services stacks.
