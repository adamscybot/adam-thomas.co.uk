    I started tinkering in web development on a beige Intel Pentium 3 family
    computer as a kid, after becoming curious about what was going on in there.
    I thought my Geocities (RIP) fan site dedicated to my favourite magazine was
    captivating, and that feeling hasn't really left since.

    Ten or so years & a Comp Sci MEng later I begun a career that has thus far
    seen me work in a digital agency, startups (in the video space and the
    privacy space) as well as a detour into finance somewhere in between.

    That has involved me working with all sorts of difference technologies
    across the stack (still does!), and becoming familiar with modern software
    architecture. However, somewhere along the journey I have steadily carved
    out a deeper expertise in front end. I rode the front end wave early which
    allowed me to rip through the wild west of Backbone, Angular and Ember
    before finally landing where we are now with TypeScript and declaritive
    component based frameworks like React.

    Despite that specialism, I like to think I am polyglot when it comes to
    langauges and technologies, and so try to be "T-Shaped" in that I am happy
    getting going in any area of Software Engineering & I often end up dabbling
    in Dev Ops also and there are regular forays into Back End most commonly
    with Node and Java. I've also been experimenting with Rust.

    One takeaway is that I beleive the front end needs to be held to the same
    standards as the back end and that is something I strongly advocate for in
    the workplace.

    In more recent years I have progressively become involved in Engineering
    Management, whilst still also having oversight over the UI and inputting
    into wider architectural discussions. I like to grow cross-functional
    collaborative teams that have a focus on getting down to the real business
    value of the work, and I strive for highly effective communication and
    indvidual ownership within my teams.

    Building strong relationships with my team, Product, UX, and the other inner
    workings of a modern software company has been a successful endeavour for
    me, and has only strengthend further my own technical chops by keeping me
    focused on the value and keeping me pragmatic.
